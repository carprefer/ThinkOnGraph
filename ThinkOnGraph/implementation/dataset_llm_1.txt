question 0 : Where does the body of water under Kineshma Bridge originate?
topics: [('m.0fp_w3v', 'Kineshma Bridge')]
grounds: ['Valdai Hills']
====================================================================================
  The body of water under Kineshma Bridge, also known as the Kineshma River, is a tributary of the Volga River in Russia.

The Kineshma River originates in the western part of the Ural Mountains, in the Chelyabinsk Oblast of Russia. The river flows through a deep valley and passes through several small towns and villages before reaching the Volga River. The total length of the Kineshma River is approximately 250 kilometers (155 miles).

The Kineshma River is a popular destination for rafting and kayaking due to its fast-flowing water and scenic surroundings. The river is also home to a variety of fish species, including trout, grayling, and pike.

In addition to its recreational value, the Kineshma River has historical and cultural significance. The river was an important transportation route in the past, and many ancient settlements and archaeological sites are located along its banks. Today, the Kineshma River continues to be an important source of water for irrigation and drinking water supply in the region.

question 1 : Who inspired Scott Fitzgerald and also influenced Ernst JÃ¼nger?
topics: [('m.02zjd', 'F. Scott Fitzgerald'), ('m.014g17', 'Ernst Jünger')]
grounds: ['Oswald Spengler']
====================================================================================
  F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernst Jünger were both influenced by a variety of individuals and literary movements, but there are a few specific people and works that stand out as particularly influential to each of them.

For F. Scott Fitzgerald:

1. Ernest Hemingway: Hemingway was a contemporary and friend of Fitzgerald's, and their works share many similarities in terms of their focus on the Jazz Age and the disillusionment of the post-World War I era. Hemingway's spare, direct writing style and his use of understatement as a literary device are both influences that can be seen in Fitzgerald's work.
2. Gertrude Stein: Stein was a prominent literary figure and a mentor to Fitzgerald. She was known for her experimental writing style and her support of young writers, and she played a significant role in shaping Fitzgerald's early career.
3. Oscar Wilde: Wilde's wit and his use of irony and satire are both influences that can be seen in Fitzgerald's work. Wilde's playful use of language and his exploration of the decadence and excess of the Jazz Age are also themes that are present in Fitzgerald's writing.
4. Edith Wharton: Wharton was a fellow American writer who was known for her novels of manners, such as "The Age of Innocence." Her work shares many similarities with Fitzgerald's in terms of its focus on the social and cultural upheavals of the Jazz Age, and her use of irony and satire to explore the tensions between tradition and modernity.

For Ernst Jünger:

1. Friedrich Nietzsche: Nietzsche's philosophy of the "will to power" and his ideas about the death of God are both influences that can be seen in Jünger's work. Jünger was deeply influenced by Nietzsche's ideas about the need for individuals to create their own values and meaning in a world without a higher power.
2. Arthur Schopenhauer: Schopenhauer's philosophy of pessimism and his ideas about the futility of human existence are also influences that can be seen in Jünger's work. Jünger was drawn to Schopenhauer's ideas about the need for individuals to find meaning and purpose in life despite the bleakness of the world around them.
3. Martin Heidegger: Heidegger's philosophy of Being and his ideas about the nature of human existence are also influences that can be seen in Jünger's work. Jünger was drawn to Heidegger's ideas about the need for individuals to confront the fundamental questions of existence and to find meaning and purpose in life despite the challenges and uncertainties of the modern world.
4. Friedrich Hölderlin: Hölderlin's poetry and his ideas about the need for individuals to find meaning and purpose in a world that is disconnected from the natural world are also influences that can be seen in Jünger's work. Jünger was drawn to Hölderlin's ideas about the need for individuals to find a connection to the natural world and to the timeless and eternal aspects of human existence.

question 4 : What is the currency used in Costa Rica?

grounds: ['Costa Rican colón']
====================================================================================
  The official currency of Costa Rica is the Costa Rican colón (CRC). It is represented by the symbol "₡" and is divided into 100 centimos.

You can exchange your currency for colones at a local bank or currency exchange office, or you can use an ATM to withdraw colones using your debit or credit card. Many businesses in Costa Rica also accept US dollars and other major currencies, but it's always a good idea to have some local currency on hand for smaller purchases and transactions.

It's worth noting that Costa Rica has a relatively stable currency, and the exchange rate is generally consistent with other major currencies. However, it's always a good idea to check the current exchange rate before traveling to ensure that you have an accurate idea of the value of your money.

grounds: ['Scientist']
====================================================================================
  The quote "Mysteries are due to secrecy" is attributed to the French philosopher and writer, Jean-Paul Sartre.

Sartre was a prominent existentialist philosopher who was born in 1905 and died in 1980. He was known for his ideas on existentialism, phenomenology, and the human condition, and his works include "Being and Nothingness," "Existentialism is a Humanism," and "Nausea."

Sartre's quote "Mysteries are due to secrecy" is a reflection of his belief that many of the mysteries of the human experience are rooted in the secrecy and hiddenness of human existence. According to Sartre, the secrecy and hiddenness of human existence create a sense of mystery and ambiguity that is inherent to the human condition.

In this sense, Sartre's quote can be seen as a commentary on the nature of human existence and the ways in which it is characterized by secrecy and hiddenness.

grounds: ['Modernism']
====================================================================================
  Henri Matisse did not use any specific art genre in his work "Scenario for a Human Drama, II: Immediate Background." Matisse was a pioneer of Fauvism, a movement characterized by the use of bold, vibrant colors and expressive brushwork, and his work in this piece reflects that style.

"Scenario for a Human Drama, II: Immediate Background" is a painting that Matisse created in 1947, towards the end of his career. It is a large-scale work, measuring over 7 feet tall and 10 feet wide, and it features a complex composition of interlocking shapes and forms. The painting is characterized by its use of bold, flat colors and its dynamic, expressive brushwork, which gives the work a sense of energy and movement.

While Matisse did experiment with a range of artistic styles throughout his career, including Fauvism, Expressionism, and even sculpture, he is perhaps best known for his work in the Fauvist tradition. Fauvism was a movement that emerged in the early 20th century, characterized by the use of bold, vibrant colors and expressive brushwork. Matisse was one of the leading figures of this movement, and his work in "Scenario for a Human Drama, II: Immediate Background" reflects his signature style.

  The Battle of Vicksburg took place in 1863 during the American Civil War. While many politicians who fought in the battle later went on to hold public office, there is no single politician who entered office first after the battle.

Some notable politicians who fought in the Battle of Vicksburg and later held public office include:

1. Ulysses S. Grant: Grant was a Union general during the Civil War and later became the 18th President of the United States. He entered office in 1869, more than six years after the Battle of Vicksburg.
2. William Tecumseh Sherman: Sherman was a Union general during the Civil War and later became a prominent politician. He was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1868 and served until 1871.
3. James B. McPherson: McPherson was a Union general during the Civil War and later became a politician. He was elected as a Republican to the U.S. Senate in 1871 and served until his death in 1872.
4. John A. Logan: Logan was a Union general during the Civil War and later became a politician. He was elected as a Republican to the U.S. Senate in 1868 and served until 1871.

It's worth noting that these politicians entered office at different times and in different capacities, so it's difficult to determine which one entered office first after the Battle of Vicksburg.

====================================================================================
  Domari is not a currency, but rather a language spoken by the Domari people, who are a nomadic ethnic group living in Egypt and Sudan.

In 2013, the official currency of Egypt, where the Domari people are primarily found, was the Egyptian pound (EGP). The exchange rate for the US dollar to the Egyptian pound in 2013 was approximately 1 USD = 5.8 EGP.

It's important to note that the Domari people are not a distinct ethnic group with their own currency or financial system. They are a marginalized group that has historically faced discrimination and poverty, and many of them live in poverty and lack access to basic services such as healthcare and education.

Therefore, any financial transactions or transactions involving the Domari people would likely be conducted in Egyptian pounds, as this is the official currency of the country where they reside.

grounds: ['Joan Mir']
====================================================================================
  One artist who was influenced by Hans Arp and was an influence to Jackson Pollock is Mark Rothko.

Hans Arp was a German-French artist who was active in the early 20th century and was known for his work in Dadaism and Surrealism. He was a pioneer of the movement known as "Surrealist Automatism," which emphasized the subconscious and the irrational. Arp's work often featured biomorphic forms and abstract shapes, which were influenced by his interest in the natural world and his belief in the power of the subconscious.

Mark Rothko, on the other hand, was an American artist who was active in the mid-20th century and is best known for his large-scale, color-field paintings. Rothko's work was heavily influenced by the Abstract Expressionist movement, which emphasized the expressive power of color and the subconscious. Rothko's paintings often feature large, rectangular fields of color that are meant to evoke emotions and create a sense of the sublime.

Rothko was heavily influenced by Arp's work, particularly his use of biomorphic forms and his emphasis on the subconscious. Rothko often spoke about the importance of the subconscious in art, and he saw his own work as a way of tapping into the deepest, most primal aspects of the human psyche. Rothko also admired Arp's use of color and his ability to create a sense of depth and dimensionality through his paintings.

In turn, Rothko was an influence on Pollock, who was also an Abstract Expressionist. Pollock's work, like Rothko's, features large-scale, gestural paintings that are meant to evoke emotions and create a sense of the sublime. Pollock's paintings often feature complex patterns of drips, splatters, and marks that are meant to suggest the unconscious mind at work.

Overall, the influence of Hans Arp on Mark Rothko and Jackson Pollock can be seen in the emphasis on the subconscious and the use of color and gesture to evoke emotions. These artists were all interested in exploring the deepest, most primal aspects of the human psyche through their work, and they saw their art as a way of tapping into the unconscious mind.

  The artist who created the famous art series of "Water Lilies" is Claude Monet. Here are some of the things that inspired him:

1. Nature: Monet was deeply inspired by the natural beauty of the garden at his home in Giverny, France, where he lived for over 40 years. The water lilies in his pond were a constant source of inspiration for him, and he painted them numerous times throughout his career.
2. Impressionism: Monet was a leading figure in the Impressionist movement, which emphasized capturing the fleeting effects of light and color in outdoor settings. His Water Lilies paintings reflect this style, with their soft, feathery brushstrokes and vivid, shimmering colors.
3. Japanese art: Monet was fascinated by Japanese art and culture, and he incorporated elements of it into his work. The flat, stylized forms and bold colors of Japanese prints can be seen in some of his Water Lilies paintings.
4. Personal experiences: Monet's personal experiences and emotions also played a role in his Water Lilies series. He often painted the lilies in different lighting conditions and weather, capturing the changing moods and atmospheres of the garden.
5. Experimentation: Monet was constantly experimenting with new techniques and materials, and this is evident in his Water Lilies series. He used different colors and brushstrokes to create a sense of movement and depth in the paintings, and he often layered multiple layers of paint to achieve the desired effect.

Overall, Monet's Water Lilies series was inspired by a combination of his love of nature, his artistic style, and his personal experiences and emotions.

====================================================================================
  J.R.R. Tolkien did not attend university with a large number of postgraduates. In fact, Tolkien did not attend university at all. He was primarily home-schooled by his father and mother, and he later attended King Edward's School in Birmingham, England.

Tolkien did not pursue higher education beyond his secondary education, and he instead served in World War I as an intelligence officer in the British Army. After the war, he worked as a professor of Anglo-Saxon studies at Oxford University, where he taught for more than 20 years and where he wrote much of his famous Middle-earth stories, including "The Hobbit" and "The Lord of the Rings."

So, to answer your question, there is no university that J.R.R. Tolkien attended with a large number of postgraduates, as he did not attend university at all.

grounds: ['Presidential system']
====================================================================================
  Since 1979, the Government of Iran has been an Islamic republic. The Islamic Republic of Iran was established after the Iranian Revolution, which overthrew the monarchy and established an Islamic republic. The current government of Iran is based on the principles of Velayat-e Faqih, which means "Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist," and is led by a Supreme Leader who is the highest-ranking religious and political authority in the country. The government is divided into executive, legislative, and judicial branches, but the Supreme Leader holds significant power and influence over all three branches.

The government of Iran has been led by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei since 1989, when he succeeded Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who was the founder of the Islamic Republic. Ayatollah Khamenei has been the Supreme Leader of Iran since then, and has played a central role in shaping the country's political and economic policies.

Iran's government is known for its strict adherence to Islamic law and its opposition to Western influence and intervention in the region. The government has been criticized by human rights groups and other countries for its treatment of political opponents, women, and minority groups, as well as its nuclear program and its support for militant groups in the Middle East.

Overall, the government of Iran since 1979 has been characterized by its commitment to Islamic principles and its rejection of Western-style democracy and human rights. While the government has made some efforts to reform and open up to the outside world, it remains a highly authoritarian and repressive regime that has faced significant criticism and opposition both within Iran and from other countries.

topics: [('m.0chghy', 'Australia'), ('m.01kfm7', 'Emanuel Lasker')]
grounds: ['Constitutional monarchy']
====================================================================================
  The birthplace of Emanuel Lasker is Germany, and Australia is a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy.

Therefore, both Australia and Germany use a form of government known as a parliamentary democracy or parliamentary system. In this system, the government is headed by a prime minister or chancellor, who is the head of government and is responsible for running the day-to-day affairs of the government. The prime minister is usually the leader of the political party or coalition that has the most seats in the legislature (such as a parliament or congress).

In a parliamentary system, the head of state (such as a president or monarch) serves a largely ceremonial role and has limited powers compared to the head of government. The legislature (such as a parliament or congress) is the body that has the power to make laws and oversee the government. Members of the legislature are elected by the people, and the government is accountable to the legislature and the people.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
