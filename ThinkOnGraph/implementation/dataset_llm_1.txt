====================================================================================
  The person who said "Seriously, I do not think I fit for the presidency" is Barack Obama. In 2004, when he was a U.S. Senator from Illinois, he gave a speech at the Democratic National Convention in which he said:

"Seriously, I do not think I fit for the presidency. I mean, you gotta be kidding. I'm just a community organizer. I'm just a lawyer from Illinois who's been involved in some local politics. I don't know how I'd be as president."

At the time, Obama was relatively unknown on the national stage, and many people doubted that he had the experience and qualifications to be president. However, he went on to win the Democratic nomination and eventually the presidency in 2008, defeating Republican candidate John McCain.

The official language of Ukraine is Ukrainian, which is the most widely spoken language in the country. However, many Ukrainians also speak Russian, and there are significant linguistic and cultural differences between the two languages.

Ukrainian is the official language of the Ukrainian government, education, media, and other official institutions. It is a Slavic language that is closely related to Russian, Belarusian, and other East Slavic languages.

In contrast, the UOC uses Church Slavonic, a liturgical language that is used in Orthodox worship services, as its official language. Church Slavonic is a Slavic language that is closely related to Old Church Slavonic, the language of the early Christian Slavs. It is used in the liturgy and other religious texts of the UOC, as well as in some educational and cultural contexts.

  Fox Mulder and JRR Tolkien are fictional characters, so they did not actually attend any university. Additionally, Tolkien passed away in 1973, while Mulder is a fictional character from the TV show "The X-Files," which was created in 1993.
