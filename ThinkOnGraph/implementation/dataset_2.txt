  A:

* Stratford: {0.5}

Explanation: Stratford is the hometown of Justin Bieber, and therefore has a direct connection to the question. However, the question specifically asks about the instruments used by Justin Bieber, and Stratford does not provide any direct information on that topic. Therefore, the score for Stratford is 0.5.

* Joseph Cook: {0.1}
* Grace Pace Cook: {0.1}

Explanation:

For this question, the entities' contribution to the question is based on their relevance to the topic of Captain James Cook. Here are the scores I calculated for each entity:

* James Cook: As the captain of the HMS Endeavour, James Cook is the most relevant entity to the question. He is the primary figure associated with the expedition and the topic of the question, so he scores a 0.5.
* Nathaniel Cook: Nathaniel Cook is James Cook's son, and while he is related to the captain, he is not directly associated with the expedition or the topic of the question. Therefore, he scores a 0.2.
* George Cook: George Cook is not a well-known figure in the context of Captain James Cook or the HMS Endeavour. He is not directly related to the topic of the question, so he scores a 0.1.
* Elizabeth Cook: Elizabeth Cook is James Cook's wife, but she is not directly associated with the expedition or the topic of the question. Therefore, she scores a 0.1.
* Hugh Cook: Hugh Cook is not a well-known figure in the context of Captain James Cook or the HMS Endeavour. He is not directly related to the topic of the question, so he scores a 0.1.
* Joseph Cook: Joseph Cook is not a well-known figure in the context of Captain James Cook or the HMS Endeavour. He is not directly related to the topic of the question, so he scores a 0.1.
* Grace Pace Cook: Grace Pace Cook is James Cook's daughter, but she is not directly associated with the expedition or the topic of the question. Therefore, she scores a 0.1.

By calculating the score for each entity individually, I have determined that James Cook is the most relevant entity to the question, followed by Nathaniel Cook.

Explanation:

Captain James Cook is a well-known historical figure, and his legacy has been the subject of many books, articles, and other works. Therefore, the score for Captain Cook is higher than that of Blue Latitudes, which is a more recent work that builds upon and expands upon the existing knowledge about Cook's legacy.
