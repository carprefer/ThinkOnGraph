1. {film.film_subject.films <Score> 0.8} This relation is highly relevant as it directly relates to the topic of male nudity in movies, and Tupac is known to have acted in several films that feature male nudity.
2. {common.topic.notable_for <Score> 0.6} This relation is also relevant as it provides a broader context for the topic of male nudity in movies, and Tupac's association with this topic could help identify the specific film he appeared in.
3. {kg.object_profile.prominent_type <Score> 0.4} This relation is less relevant as it provides general information about the type of objects that Tupac is associated with, but does not directly relate to the topic of male nudity in movies.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
