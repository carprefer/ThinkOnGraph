  Sure, I can score each entity's contribution to the question based on their relevance to the query. Here are the scores for each entity in the format you requested:

* Black: {0.5}
* White: {0.3}
* Beige: {0.2}

Explanation:

* Black: The term "Black" is relevant to the question as it is a common color associated with dogs, particularly in the context of breed names. However, it is not the most specific term related to the query, as there are many dog breeds that come in various shades of black. Therefore, I scored Black at 0.5.
* White: White is also a common color associated with dogs, particularly in the context of purebred breeds. It is a more specific term than Black, as there are many breeds that are known for their white coats, such as the White German Shepherd. I scored White at 0.3, as it is less relevant to the question than Black.
* Beige: Beige is not a common color associated with dogs, and it does not have a direct relation to the query. Therefore, I scored Beige at 0.2.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
